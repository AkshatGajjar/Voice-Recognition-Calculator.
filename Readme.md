# Voice Recognition Calculator

## Overview
This project is a complete, **voice recognition system built in C++**. It is designed to recognize spoken digits (0â€“9) and function as a simple, voice-operated calculator.

The application operates in two main phases:
1. **Training Phase**  
   - Processes a dataset of pre-recorded audio files for each digit.  
   - Extracts key features from the audio.  
   - Generates a universal codebook of sound characteristics.  
   - Trains a distinct Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for each digit (0â€“9).  

2. **Live Calculator Phase**  
   - After training and testing are complete, the program launches an interactive command-line calculator.  
   - Uses the computer's microphone to record the user's voice.  
   - Recognizes the spoken command using the trained HMMs.  
   - Performs the requested calculation.
